# Github Issue Scraper
### Live Application: http://jseligman-issue-scraper.herokuapp.com/

### Possible Improvements
  * Improve parsing of url to allow user to enter any permutation of the repo url rather than just the base url (ex. right now https://github.com/nodejs/node works but https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues doesn't)
  * Refactor the API call to more efficiently get all paginated results
  * Improve UI
